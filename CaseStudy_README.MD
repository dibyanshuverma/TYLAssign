### 📝 Objective


You're working on a new system which handles finanial transactions. The system will need to interact with databases, caching, and possibly third-party services for things like payment processing and fraud detection. Your task is to design the system, ensuring that the system is resiliant and scalable. Due to time constraints, you don't have to implement the full system. Instead, focus on key DevSecOps aspects like Infrastructure as Code Security, Application Security, Monitoring and Shift Left etc.

### 📚 System Description

 

The system will be responsible for:

- 💳 Processing credit and debit card transactions

- 🛡️ Implementing basic fraud detection mechanisms

- 📊 Providing real-time metrics for transactions

### 🛠️ Requirements

 

1. **🎨 Design Sketch**:

   - Draw a basic cloud architecture diagram for the system. Use any drawing tool you're comfortable with.

 

2. **💻 Infrastructure as Code**:

   - Write the code to provision a couple of key infrastructure components for your design. This could be a SQL Database and a Web App Service on Azure, for example. Use any IaC language you are comfortable with (e.g Bicep, Terraform).

 

3. **🔁 CI/CD**:

   - Implement a simple CI/CD pipeline that triggers off commits to the `main` branch. Use any implementation language you are comfortable with (e.g Azure yaml pipelines). The pipeline should:

      - 🏗️ Build any code or templates you've created

      - 🧪 Run any available unit tests

      - 🚀 Deploy your Infrastructure as Code templates and application
